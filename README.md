Foe Ain Shams University assignment 6 for lab (Exception Handling)

You have to enter the file path for the arxml files or the non arxml files when running our program.
also you have to remove the quotation marks at the start and the end of the file path

The batch file is in the dist folder inside the project file and it is named New Text Document

There are provided files for normal arxml files and empty ones and also non arxml files so that they can be used for testing . only their path have to be copied.

There is also an extra step done in the code which is not needed and that is the printing of all the content of the arxml file if it is an arxml non empty file
